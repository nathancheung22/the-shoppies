# The Shoppies

## For Shopify's Front-End internship project

Check it out [here](https://omdb-shoppies.netlify.app/)

Features:

- Written in React / Bootstrap
- Persistent storage (nominations stay even when tab is closed)
- Rearrange nomination orders
- Very cool Bitmojis

Developer notes:

- I think I only have 1000 API calls per day, please don't overload my apiKey
- Feel free to look at my code, but please don't steal it and submit it to Shopify. It would make me really sad ðŸ˜¢
